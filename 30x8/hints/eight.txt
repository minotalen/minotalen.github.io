level 1:
step onto the marked tile, then press right
combine the 2s in the same way

level 2:
this time your goal is to make a four
where does the second 3 go?

level 4:
in the last level you created a J shape of 2s
this time you need to create an L

level 5:
there are 10 1s on the board, you only need 8 to make a 4

level 6:
l6.1.gif
this 2x2 shape is called an O
you need an O of 3s to create the 5

level 7:
you don't need to place the 1 right away
it is possible to combine a number onto a target tile
you need to make an L again (check level 4 hint 3)

level 8:
you can not make any mistake combining the 1s

level 9:
you can make the first 4 without using any numbers from the bank!

level 10:
this time you have to make a long distance combination
consider symmetry

think about where you need to create the two 3s
you can achieve this with an O and a J shape

see where you could make the second 7, then work backwards from that
l13.1.png

think long distance again
you know where the 3s have to go

from here on you are on your own (until I finish the hints!)
