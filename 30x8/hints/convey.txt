combine numbers by pushing a line of same numbers (1+1,2+2,...) into an empty tile
crushing: press action on a number to lower it by one. this always has some additional benefit

use you available potential wisely, every time you crush you lose valuable resources!
checkpoint:  step onto the flag to create a checkpoint. previous checkpoints can be selected from the game bar.
generators: combining numbers charges the generators. a generator that is charged a second time spawns a 1.

finesse: standing on an empty tile while combining to a 4 or bigger spawns a 1 under the cursor

this round you have fewer resources, so try not wasting any finesse! making an 8 presents 31 chances to make finesse.

blockades:  place a blockade on an empty tile with action, discharges a counter. pick it up the same way.
blockades can be used to stop generator lanes from pushing further. they can also prevent finesse which is sometimes useful.
you can discharge a blue generator with action

the finesse for 7 is special

this one is only possible if you make good use of generators and finesse
