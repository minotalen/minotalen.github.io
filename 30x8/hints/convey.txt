rules:  combine numbers by pushing into a line of same numbers (1+1,2+2,...) to create the next higher number
checkpoint:  step onto the flag to create a checkpoint 
crushing:  press action o a number to lower it by one. 
crushing a 3   spawns a 1 on the bank and  refreshes a counter
crushing a 4   spawns a push item which can push a number one tile far
crushing a 5   spawns the grow item which can grow a number+1 up to 4
crushing a 6   spawns the pick up item which allows you to pick up a number up to 5 
generators: combining numbers charges the generators. a generator that is charged a second time spawns a 1 to the left of it 
hint  using a counter on a generator to spawn a 1 in the right moments can help align bigger numbers.
hint: only the generators with a white circle have the potential to spawn after the next combination 
counter:  pressing space on a generator also spawns a 1 but discharges a counter 
finesse:  if you stand on an empty tile while combining you will spawn a 1 there 
blockades:  place a blockade on an empty tile with action, discharges  a counter    pick it up the same way 
place a blockade under you before combining to block finesse
blockades are also supposed to block generator lanes but that isn't fully working yet
