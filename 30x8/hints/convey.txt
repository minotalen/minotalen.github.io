rules:  combine numbers by pushing into a line of same numbers (1+1,2+2,...) to create the next higher number
checkpoint:  step onto the flag to create a checkpoint. previous checkpoints can be selected from the game bar.
crushing:  press action on a number to lower it by one. this always has some additional benefit
crushing a 2 refreshes a counter
crushing a 3 spawns a 1 on the bank
crushing a 4 spawns a push item which can push a number one tile far
crushing a 5 spawns the grow item which can grow a number+1 (with max. value 4)
crushing a 6 spawns the pick up item which allows you to pick up a number (with max. value 5)
generators: combining numbers charges the generators. a generator that is charged a second time spawns a 1.
generator lanes can be used to push numbers (sometimes they get jammed by high numbers though).
you can combine generator charges the same way you combine numbers.
only the generators with a white circle have the potential to spawn after the next combination.
counter:  pressing space on a generator charges it but discharges a counter
using counters on a generator to spawn a 1 in the right moments can help align bigger numbers.

finesse:  if you stand on an empty tile while combining to a number 4 or bigger you will spawn a 1 there.
finesse on 7: when you combine a pair of 6s you grow the tile under your cursor +1
during the making of an ideal eight there are 31 finesse triggers, try not to waste those potential resources!

blockades:  place a blockade on an empty tile with action, discharges a counter. pick it up the same way.
blockades can be used to stop generator lanes from pushing further. they can also prevent finesse which is sometimes useful.

use you available potential wisely, everytime you crush you lose valuable resources!
