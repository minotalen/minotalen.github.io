rules:  combine numbers by pushing into a line of same numbers (1+1,2+2,...) to create the next higher number
crushing:  press action on a number to lower it by one. this always has some additional benefit
use you available potential wisely, every time you crush you lose valuable resources!

finesse: standing on an empty tile while combining to a 4 or bigger spawns a 1 under the cursor

this round you have fewer resources, so try not wasting any finesse! making an 8 presents 31 chances to make finesse.

blockades:  place a blockade on an empty tile with action, discharges a counter. pick it up the same way.
blockades can be used to stop generator lanes from pushing further. they can also prevent finesse which is sometimes useful.
you can discharge a blue generator with action

the finesse for 7 is special
