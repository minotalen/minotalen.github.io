level 2:
create a line of 2s,
the line is horizontal
combine those to the right

level 3:
make a horizontal line of 3s
all 2s on the right need to combine left
the other 2 1s combine down, this formation of 2s is called a J

level 4:
the two rightmost 1s can only combine in a certain direction
which means the leftmost 2x2 formation of 2s needs to move out of the way
the 3s are created to the right of the target 4

level 5:
you need another 5. where does it need to be created?
if you know where the 5 has to go, where can you create the 2 4s needed for that?
all 2s and 3s are combined to the left

level 6:
the 2 leftmost 1s can't go anywhere but right
you are looking to recreate a shape of 2s
because of symmetry this can be either an upside-down L or J

level 7:
start at the goal and work your way backwards
when combining the 2 1s, where do you want the 2 to end up?|
place the 1 from the bank to the left of the other 1

level 8:
start by making a 3 with the 4 1s
a 2x2 block of same numbers is called an O.
dropping the 1 on the target 5 creates an O which combines to the left, then up.

level 9:
have you thought about combining before you place the 1?
you want to make an L of 1s
the nose of the L sits on the target
